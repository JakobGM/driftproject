# Driftproject for New Members of FG-Drift
This repository provides several project tasks which can be performed in order to get some hands on experience with performing work in the terminal.

## Intstructions for the 0th Project
All the projects are located in the [instructions](instructions) folder.
1. Open the file [instructions/0-getting_started.md](instructions/0-getting_started.md).
2. Follow the steps.

## Instructions for the 1st Project
1. Fork this repository directly from GitHub. This makes a direct copy of this repository, which is under your control.
2. Clone the newly forked repository to for instance `$HOME/dev/driftproject`
3. Navigate to [`instructions/1-dotfiles.md`](instructions/1-dotfiles.md) and follow the instructions. Good luck!

PS: You will probably want to keep your forked version of this repository (called a downstream repository) up to date with the original repository (called the upstream repository). In order to do this, you can run the following git command: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/JakobGM/driftproject`. Now you can pull down the latest commits from the upstream repository by running `git pull upstream master`.
