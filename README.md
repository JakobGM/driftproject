# Driftproject for New Members of FG-Drift
This repository provides several project tasks which can be performed in order to get some hands on experience with performing work in the terminal.

## Instructions
1. Fork this repository directly from GitHub. This makes a direct copy of this repository, which is under your control.
2. Clone the newly forked repository to for instance $HOME/dev/driftproject
3. Navigate to instructions/1-dotfiles.md and follow the instructions. Good luck!

PS: You will probably want to keep your forked version of this repository (called a downstream repository) up to date with the original repository (called the upstream repository). In order to do this, you can run the following git command: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/JakobGM/driftproject`. Now you can pull down the latest commits from the upstream repository by running `git pull upstream master`.
