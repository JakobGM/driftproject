# File hosting on Thorium

The goal of this exercise is to host arbitrary files from thorium. By the end you should be able to browse a file directory available at files.$USER.oraklel.ntnu.no

## Writing the virtal host configuration file
- Later in this task we will use nginx to host files. Start by creating the virtual host file for such a site in this repository. Save it at $USER/$FILENAME. If you follow conventions, what should $FILENAME be set to? If you don't know, ask! Write the configuration file in order to get the following behaviour (hint: a tutorial for virtualhost files can be found [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-nginx-server-blocks-virtual-hosts-on-ubuntu-16-04)):
    - The website should be available at files.$USER.orakel.ntnu.no, and should listen to port 80
    - The website's files should be served from /var/www/$WEBSITENAME
    - Enable automatic indexing of files in every folder, such that index.html files are generated by nginx (hint: nginx autoindex)
    - If you visit $WEBSITENAME/folder the server shall serve the url $website/folder/index.html

## Deploying the site
