# File hosting on Thorium

The goal of this exercise is to host arbitrary files from a webserver (Thorium in our case). By the end you should be able to browse a file directory available at files.$USER.orakel.ntnu.no

## Writing the virtal host configuration file
- Later in this task we will use nginx to host files. Start by creating the virtual host file for such a site in this repository. Save it at $USER/$FILENAME. If you follow conventions, what should $FILENAME be? If you don't know, ask! Write the configuration file in order to get the following behaviour (hint: a tutorial for virtualhost files can be found [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-nginx-server-blocks-virtual-hosts-on-ubuntu-16-04)):
    - The website should be available at files.$USER.orakel.ntnu.no, and should listen to port 80
    - The website's files should be served from /var/www/$WEBSITENAME
    - Enable automatic indexing of files in every folder, such that index.html files are generated by nginx (hint: nginx autoindex)
    - If you visit $WEBSITENAME/folder the server should serve the url $website/folder/index.html

## Terminal configuration for simpler dev ops
- If you haven't already done so, you should have an "env.zsh" file in your $ZSH_CUSTOM directory which keeps track of all your personal environment variables which you would like to have access to. You should add a subsection to this file (use a descriptive comment) for all the hosts that you have access to. Here you can use lower case variable names, as these are custom variables, and not predetermined OS variables. Add for example "export thorium=thorium.orakel.ntnu.no', and likewise for $atlas and $logstud. After having sourced the file, you should be able to write "ssh username@$thorum" and the shell replaces $thorium with the more cumbersome correct hostname.
- While the approach described above has the benefit that in can be used in conjunction with arbitrary programs (i.e. ping $thorium), there is an even better solution for saving some time when connecting to different servers with ssh. The solution is the configuration file of ssh, located at ~/.ssh/config. If it doesn't already exist, create it. This configuration file allows us to set up ssh (and by proxy, other programs that utilize ssh, like git, scp and ssh-copy-id) such that we can write "ssh thorium", and ssh then fills in the correct hostname, username, port, and identity file. A quick introduction to the ssh config file syntax can be found [here](http://nerderati.com/2011/03/17/simplify-your-life-with-an-ssh-config-file/). Use this to do the following:
    - Create the ssh config file
    - Add thorium, atlas, and logstud as hosts. If you have any other available hosts, add these as well.
    - Add correct usernames and ports for all these hosts.
    - Create new RSA keys such that you end up having three RSA keys. id_rsa for various private servers of yours, ntnu_rsa for all NTNU-affiliated servers, and github_rsa for use with GitHub (duh!). If you need a reminder for how to do this, take a look at [this DO guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2). Remember to add a descriptive comment to every new key pair (hint: -C)! Add these key pairs to their respective hosts in the ssh config file (they are called IdentityFiles in the config).
    - Now add the ssh key to your GitHub account in order to allow you to use it for git authentication. [Here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/) is a guide. Test it by cloning a private Orakeltjenesten repository you have access to, but remember to use the ssh repository link and not the https one. If you have done everything correctly, you should neither be prompted for a username, nor a password.
